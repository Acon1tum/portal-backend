### Clarification on the Login Limit Logic

Thank you for the clarification. My understanding is that you want to limit the creation of new accounts during login based on the user's `userType` and `userRole`.

The current login process in `src/auth/login.ts` already implements a similar logic when a user is migrated from Supabase. Here's how it works:

1.  If a user is not found in the local database, the system tries to authenticate them against Supabase.
2.  If the authentication is successful, the system retrieves the user's `userType` and `userRole` from Supabase.
3.  It then calls the `isEligibleForMigration` function to check if the user's `userType` and `userRole` combination is allowed to be migrated and created in the local database.
4.  The `isEligibleForMigration` function contains the logic for this filtering. You can find this function in `src/auth/login.ts` and `src/services/migrationService.ts`.

**My Questions to You:**

1.  Does the existing `isEligibleForMigration` logic meet your requirements? Or do you want to modify it?
2.  Are you expecting users to be created even if they don't exist in Supabase? If so, what `userType` and `userRole` should be assigned to them, and how should we decide if they are eligible for creation?

Please let me know your thoughts on this, so I can proceed with the correct implementation.
